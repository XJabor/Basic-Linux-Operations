- In Linux, everything is a file. Everything is stored in a hierarchical nature
![[02-filesystem.png]]
- At the top of the filesystem is the "root" or "/" directory. Everything fits below
- Your "home" directory is typically where your users' files (Desktop, Documents, etc.) are stored
- If your username was "Fred", then your files would be in ```/home/Fred```
	- If you wanted to get to your Desktop, the path would be ```/home/Fred/Desktop```
*Note: Everything in Linux is case-sensitive*
*Note: The tilde (~)  is an alias for your default home directory*
*Note: The contents of each of the major sub-directories is beyond the scope of this course*
