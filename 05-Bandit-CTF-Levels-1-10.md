You will now work through the bandit CTF levels 1 - 10 on your own
For each level, you must:
1. Provide the commands you used and what those commands do (in your own words)
2. The password for each level
3. You may use any text editor. GUI or command line is acceptable
4. If you are stuck, use the tips provided by the game. If you are still stuck, research you issue online (AI is fine). If you are still stuck, ask your instructor. You must tell your instructor what you have done to solve the problem before they will help you. The instructor may help you with the problem directly or provide guidance for further research
5. You may **==not==** use guides for Bandit CTF that are on the internet
