You will now work through the bandit CTF levels 1 - 10 on your own
For each level, you must:
1. Provide the commands you used and what those commands do (in your own words)
2. The password for each level
3. You may use any text editor. GUI or command line is acceptable
4. If you are stuck, use the tips provided by the game. If you are still stuck, research you issue online. If you are still stuck, ask your instructor. You must tell your instructor what you have done to solve the problem before they will help you. The instructor may help you with the problem directly or provide guidance for further research
5. You may **==not==** use guides for Bandit CTF that are on the internet
6. Avoid using AI for your initial research. The goal is to build fundamental skills; AI will give you the exact answer you need which defeats the purpose.

# Tips and Tricks
- Press the "up" arrow to go to your last command. Keep pressing the "up" arrow to go back further in your command history

- The "tab" button can be used to autocomplete entries in the command line. Using the "tab" key to autocomplete saves time and reduces the chance for spelling mistakes. Use it often, it will help with the challenges

- Use the ```exit``` command to quit your current SSH session

- Press "CTRL + L" to clear the contents of your screen. This is helpful to keep an organized terminal

- There is a way to ignore errors (like permission denied) when finding things in the terminal

- You do not need to go to where the file exists to access it. Any file can be accessed from anywhere using the full path name. Reference [[03-Linux-Filesystem]] as necessary

- Linux has built in manuals for many commands. If you wanted to look at the manual for "ssh" you would use the command ```man ssh```
